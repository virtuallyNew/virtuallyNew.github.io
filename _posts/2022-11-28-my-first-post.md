This is my first post Jekyll and Chirpy. I used the Jekyll-Compose plug in to create the post. I then used VI to edit the markdown file in _posts. 

You can add catagories up to two levels and unlimited tags. The syntax is simple and just add the categories and tags into the existing header below date. 

categories: [ Animal, Insect ]
tags: [ bee ]
*remove the space [word]

To add an avatar edit the _config.yml and find the avatar line.

avatar: 'https://github.com/UserName.png'
